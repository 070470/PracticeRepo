# Week report 2

This week I've been doing a lot of basic research on how Python projects
are built and managed, and looked into testing especially. I also chose
the algorithm I'm going to use to parse the user input in the program, which
is the biggest challenge in my project. I've certainly learned a lot about
these topics, though there's still more to learn especially in implementing
them in practice. This week's work has taken up around 7 hours.

I've created the file which is going to contain the main functionalities of
my program, as well as the testing file, and I've began implementing both.
I'm yet to configure the coverage measurement part of the project, but I'm 
most likely going to use Coverage.py as the tool for doing it.

I'm probably going to change the framework for my project as well - Django
isn't really the most suitable for the kind of project I'm doing - I could
go a lot simpler. I'm also still familiarizing myself with the Shunting-yard
-algorithm so that I'll have a more solid understanding of how it works once
I actually start implementing it, which would be during this next week. I'll
also have to look into virtual environments more next week, and set one up
for my project.
