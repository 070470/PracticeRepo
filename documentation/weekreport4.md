# Week report 4

This week I've been implementing the core algorithm of the program and making
some additional methods to help with processing the clause. I've been swamped
with work so unfortunately I haven't been able to progress as fast as I'd
like to, but I'm hoping to finish implementing the main functionalities this
week and after that most of the work left will have to do with documentation
and testing.
