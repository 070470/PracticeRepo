# Week report 3

This week I've hardly had time to work on the project.
What I have been able to do, however, is study the 
algorithm I'm going to use more closely, and add the 
coverage feature to the project (though its functionality
is still in progress). I've also been studying the 
materials of the Ohjelmistotuotanto course to support me
in building this project. All of this took probably around
2 hours of active working time.

Next I'm going to start implementing the Shunting-yard
algorithm and configure the coverage functionalities.
I'll also create the testing document.
