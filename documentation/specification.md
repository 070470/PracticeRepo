# Specification
## General
I'm studying in the Bachelor's Programme in Science, and so the documentation 
of this project will be in English. The project itself will be written in
Python, and I'm comfortable reviewing projects written in Java as well as 
Python.

## About the project
The program I'm going to write is a simple calculator that takes mathematical operations
given as user input and solves them. I will do this by implementing the shunting yard algorithm
along with a postfix stack evaluation method. This approach to parsing mathematical expressions
and solving them is rather widely implemented and easily expandable to even more complex calculator
functions. The algorithms I'm using should allow for a time and space complexity of O(n).
