# Week report 5

This week I continued the implementation of the shunting-yard algorithm. I'm
late from the schedule and still have to work on the test coverage, but I'm
trying to get as much done as I can. I've also been reading through the
code I'm going to peer review. I also started writing the implementation
document.
