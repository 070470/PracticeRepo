# Weekly report 1

This week I spent some time thinking about the contents of the project,
and doing the preparations such as creating the git repository and some of
the documents needed for the project. I also spent some time doing simple
programming excercises, since I had quite a long break from programming over
the holidays. I also created the project files.

Overall, this will be my first proper programming project - I've studied
programming in both Python and Java, but never really applied it. So, it's
going to be challenging and I'll have to put in quite a bit of work.
