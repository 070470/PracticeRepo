# Specification
## General
I'm studying in the Bachelor's Programme in Science, and so the documentation 
of this project will be in English. The project itself will be written in
Python, and I'm comfortable reviewing projects written in Java as well as 
Python.

## About the project
The program I'm going to write is a simple calculator that takes operations
given as user input, and analyzes and solves them. I'm not using an existing
algorithm to dissect the input, but rather will come up with one of my own.
After  I might, however, use existing operations such as
sqrt
