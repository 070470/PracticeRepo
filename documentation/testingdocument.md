# Testing document

Tests for this project were written for all the methods that are directly involved in
processing the input, all the way to the end result of the calculation.
The other methods are simple enough not to require testing. Inputs for the tests
are not unlike those that are expected as input when the program is being used.

The tests can be done by running the following command:
> coverage run --branch -m unittest testCalculator

Furthermore, the test coverage can be seen from the coverage.html -file.
